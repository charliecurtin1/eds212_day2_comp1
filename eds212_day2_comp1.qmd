## Derivatives in R

```{r}
# use expression for derivative
# this is a comment
fx = expression(3.1 * (x ^ 4) - 28 * x)
# stores the derivative expression
df_dx <- D(fx, 'x')
# calls back the derivative expression (shows you)
df_dx

x <- 10

eval(df_dx)
# eval function, can store a value as x and evaluate the derivative at that value
```

find slope of g(z) = 2z^3^ -10.5z^2^ + 4.1 at z = 3.6

```{r}
gz = expression (2 * z ^ 3 - 10.5 * z ^ 2 + 4.1)

dg_dz <- D(gz, 'z')
# remember with sequence, you can use 'length' or 'by'
z = seq(from = 1, to = 3, length = 20)

dg_dz

f <- eval(dg_dz)
```

Making a change in the doc!

```{r}
d = 4
```
